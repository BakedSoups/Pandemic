# Maldemic
create a vius youself and watch it spread, See the live SIRD data between cities and learn how certain virus's spread more over others 

## Realtime Simulation

Using a Stochastic Markove Chain Algorithm written in numpy and sci pi, we use distance between cities to determine how likely it is for the virus to spread
we then mix up the matric and update the SIR acoordingly

Once the python program complies this infromation we then visuzalize this simulation in godot.
